# cPanel
Local Host Manager for Windows Based Apache PHP environments.

Edit Config File First. (Cog wheel on top right corner.)

You can add a host by clicking add host link. 
Give host name without "www"

This is totally file based so no installation is required, if it's not working check apache permissions.
